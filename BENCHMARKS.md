# aria vs stable-audio-tools — benchmark

aria (this runtime) vs **stable-audio-tools** (the PyTorch reference), same machine,
same model weights, same workload: **uncond, 8-step pingpong, DiT + autoencoder
decode** (no text encoder — isolates the core diffusion runtime). Both measure
**warm** generation with the model resident (aria = min of 3, SAT = mean of 3;
medium CPU = single run). Hardware: **Alienware — RTX 3070 (8 GB, sm_86) + i9-10900KF (20 threads).**

GPU: aria runs fp16 weights / fp32 compute (cuBLAS tensor cores); SAT runs fp16
(`.half()`). VRAM is the **actual process footprint** (`cudaMemGetInfo` for aria,
`mem_get_info` total−free for SAT) so the CUDA context + allocator pool are counted
for both; SAT's `max_memory_allocated` (tensors only) is shown in parentheses.

## small-music (10 s clip, 8 steps)

| metric | aria | stable-audio-tools | winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GPU time** | **0.19 s** | 0.34 s | aria (1.8×) |
| **GPU VRAM** (process) | **1548 MB** | 2770 MB (alloc 1161) | aria (−44 %) |
| **CPU time** (20 threads) | 3.5 s | **2.8 s** | SAT (1.25×) |
| **CPU peak RAM** | **2089 MB** | 5421 MB | aria (−61 %) |

## medium (GPU 10 s, CPU 5 s, 8 steps)

| metric | aria | stable-audio-tools | winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GPU time** | 0.54 s | **0.50 s** | ≈ parity (1.08×) |
| **GPU VRAM** (process) | **4314 MB** | 5452 MB (alloc 4561) | aria (−21 %) |
| **CPU time** (5 s, 20 thr) | 8.1 s | **7.0 s** | SAT (1.15×) |
| **CPU peak RAM** (5 s) | **7204 MB** | 18866 MB | aria (−62 %) |

aria GPU breakdown — small: setup 0.02 + dit ~0.14 + decode 0.02; medium: setup
**0.02** + dit **0.38** + decode **0.13**. Three profile-guided GPU optimizations took
medium **0.98 → 0.54 s** (≈ SAT parity) and small-music **0.29 → 0.19 s** (1.8× SAT):
1. **on-device cross-K/V projection** (was a per-request host GEMM): medium setup
   0.33 → **0.02 s** (`ca_to_kv` device-resident, +340 MB).
2. **fp16 tensor-core attention** for the DiT (the QK/AV ran as fp32 `sgemm` = 21 % of
   GPU time, no tensor cores). Small decoder stays fp32 (fp16 there cost accuracy for
   ~0 gain).
3. **fused sliding-window decoder attention** — the medium decoder ran full N² (N=1836)
   then masked to ±17; a warp-per-query kernel computes only the 35-key window
   (O(N·35), exact), dropping decode **0.23 → 0.13 s** and a 324 MB N² score buffer.
What's left (medium 0.54 vs 0.50) is fp32 elementwise + launch overhead — diminishing
returns. aria's DiT/decoder GEMMs are already fp16 tensor cores.

## Long audio — 60 s reference (8 steps)

The motivating workload is a **60 s** clip. Below is aria-vs-SAT at 10 s and 60 s so
the *scaling* is visible (uncond, warm; Alienware RTX 3070 + i9-10900KF).

**medium:**

| backend | aria 10 s | aria 60 s | aria 10→60 | SAT 10 s | SAT 60 s | SAT 10→60 | @ 60 s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CPU** (20 thr) | 11.2 s | **55.9 s** | 5.0× | 11.3 s | **108.4 s** | 9.6× | **aria 1.94× faster** |
| **GPU** (fp16) | 0.46 s | **1.82 s** | 4.0× | 0.49 s | **1.32 s** | 2.7× | SAT 1.38× faster |

**small-music:**

| backend | aria 10 s | aria 60 s | aria 10→60 | SAT 10 s | SAT 60 s | SAT 10→60 | @ 60 s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CPU** (20 thr) | 3.58 s | **16.3 s** | 4.6× | 2.79 s | **11.1 s** | 4.0× | SAT 1.47× faster |
| **GPU** (fp16) | 0.16 s | **0.60 s** | 3.8× | 0.34 s | **0.41 s** | 1.2× | SAT 1.46× faster |

aria 60 s stage split — medium GPU dit **1.28** + decode 0.78 s, CPU dit 35.1 + decode 20.6 s
(CPU dit after query-blocked attention, −4% on the 20-core); small-music GPU dit 0.50 +
decode 0.16 s, CPU dit 12.5 + decode 4.3 s. GPU VRAM @60 s: medium aria 4514 vs SAT 6720 MB.
The medium GPU dit dropped **1.45 → 1.28 s (−12 %)** by fusing the elementwise long tail
(see below); the gap to SAT closed 1.68× → 1.57×. Folding 1/√D into the QK^T alpha and the
fp16 cast into softmax (commit `42962e0`, byte-identical output) removed two more S²·H passes
per attention: 60 s GPU **medium 2.07 → 1.82 s (−12 %), small 0.67 → 0.60 s (−10 %)**;
the SAT gap closed further, 1.57× → **1.38×** (medium) and 1.63× → **1.46×** (small).
Fusing the medium-decoder head glue (E16.2, `cab0808`, byte-identical, 156 → 60 launches per
decode) took 60 s medium to **1.73 s** — the gap is now **1.31×**.

**small-music has no banded-decoder win** (its decoder already chunks → O(N·34) linear),
so on CPU it's pure GEMM and MKL edges aria (1.3–1.5×); the medium CPU win is specifically
the banded decoder fix. On GPU both models show the same long-audio gap (parity/ahead at
10 s → ~1.7–1.8× behind at 60 s).

**The decoder fix (CPU + GPU).** The medium decoder's ±17 sliding-window attention
ran as a full N×N score matrix + mask, where the transformer sequence `N = T×17`
(10,982 tokens at 60 s) — pure **O(N²)**: CPU decode measured 18.6 → 78.0 s when the
latent length doubled (15→30 s). A banded kernel computes only the 35-key window
(`aria_attention_band` on CPU; `k_attn_band` on GPU; both numerically exact, A/B
audio rel 1e-5). CPU decode at 60 s ~300 → 21–32 s; the win grows with duration. This
is why **aria CPU now scales *better* than PyTorch** for long audio (SAT CPU 9.6× vs
aria 5.0× from 10→60 s) — PyTorch's medium decoder still pays the growth aria shed.

**The remaining gap — GPU.** aria GPU is parity/ahead at 10 s but **~1.7–1.8× behind
at 60 s** (both models). The DiT self-attention is full O(S²) (S = 710 at 60 s) and
aria materializes the fp16 S×S scores + a softmax pass, vs PyTorch SDPA's flash
attention. **Two flash kernels were tried and reverted**, both losing to cuBLAS:
(1) an **fp32** flash made the DiT 4× slower (no tensor cores; latency-bound per-thread
online softmax); (2) a **WMMA tensor-core** flash was numerically correct (small-music
GPU-vs-CPU 1.18 %) but still slower (medium DiT 1.45→1.9 s, small 0.52→0.75 s) and
regressed medium fidelity to 5.8 %. At S ≤ 710 (S² = 0.5 M) cuBLAS GemmEx + a parallel
softmax reduction beats a hand-rolled single-warp-per-tile flash; matching PyTorch
needs a cuDNN-class **multi-warp/pipelined FlashAttention-2** kernel — large effort
for an already-fast (≤ 2.2 s) path, so deferred. The cuBLAS attention stands.

**What did help — fusing the long tail.** nsys (medium, GPU) shows the GEMMs are only
~41 % of GPU time, the attention softmax ~9 %, and a **~32 % long tail** of small
memory-bound elementwise/reshape kernels (fp16-convert, rmsnorm, RoPE, extract/merge-
heads, adaLN/gate). Fusing the biggest of these — **extract-head + per-head qk-rmsnorm +
RoPE** into one kernel (`k_extract_normrope`), plus rmsnorm+adaLN and gate+residual-add —
cut the **medium GPU DiT 1.45 → 1.28 s (−12 %)**, whole gen 2.22 → 2.07 s, parity
unchanged. It's a bigger, lower-risk lever than flash (the softmax FA-2 would touch is
only ~9 %). Remaining long-tail headroom: the per-attention fp16 conversions (have
`k_extract_normrope` emit fp16 so `attn_dev` skips them).

**CUDA Graphs (landed).** The per-step DiT is now captured once and replayed (`--default-
stream per-thread` + cuBLAS pinned to it + a fixed workspace; robust inline fallback;
`ARIA_NO_GRAPH=1` to A/B). Output is byte-identical to the inline path (rel_rmse 0). The
launch-overhead win is **modest at these sizes** — ~4 % warm-min on the medium DiT (s=24,
0.96→0.92 s), within noise on small-music — because the small audio latent keeps the DiT
compute-bound so the ~14 k launches mostly hide behind compute. The graph's clearer benefit
is **steadier per-step latency** (less launch jitter); the win grows with steps and the
medium differential path's kernel count. Also drops the redundant per-block residual copies
(3 `cudaMemcpyD2D`/block) on the same path. See PAPER.md §4.

**True Megakernel feasibility (measured, not adopted).** `tests/bench_megakernel.cu` benches a
from-scratch WMMA tensor-core GEMM vs cuBLAS `GemmEx` at the DiT FFN/qkv shapes (3070, sm_86).
The WMMA kernel is **bit-identical** to cuBLAS but **0.12–0.56×** its speed, and cuBLAS runs
these GEMMs at **18–31 TFLOP/s** (≈50–78 % of the ~40 TFLOP/s fp16-tensor peak) at only
**49–138 GB/s** (≪ 448 GB/s HBM) — i.e. **compute-bound, not memory-bound**, so a megakernel's
HBM-traffic savings buy nothing on the GEMMs. Crossover model: per-block weights 33.6/75.5 MB
(small/medium) stream regardless; activation share 35 %→69 % of HBM traffic over S=172→710;
ideal free-GEMM fusion ceiling 1.18×→1.53× (crossover S≈315/473), much of it already L2-resident.
Verdict: a 3–8× GEMM penalty vs a ≤1.53× ceiling on compute-bound kernels → **not worth it**;
cuBLAS+graph+glue-fusion is at/near the roofline. The crossover analysis is the paper result.

**fp16-emit attention epilogue (exact, landed).** The extract-head kernels
(`k_extract_normrope`, `k_extract_heads_h`) now emit fp16 q/k/v directly and the cross-K/V
request cache is stored fp16 (converted once per request, not per step), so `attn_dev_h`
consumes fp16 with zero per-call conversion passes. `__float2half` at the producer is the
same RTNE value the old fp32-store + convert pass produced → **output byte-identical**
(small + medium 60 s, graph and inline). 60 s warm: small DiT 0.41 → **0.40 s**, medium DiT
1.04 → **0.97 s** (−7 %); VRAM −50/−64 MB (small/medium).

**W8A8 int8 tensor-core GEMMs (`ARIA_W8A8=1` + `--precision q8`).** The q8 block weights are
already packed int8+scale in VRAM; instead of dequantizing to fp16 per GEMM, the activations
are quantized per-token (row absmax, symmetric, mirrors `aria_q8_quant`) and the 6 per-step
block GEMMs run **int8×int8 → int32 IMMA** (2× fp16 tensor throughput on sm_86), dequantized
in place in the fp32 output (`y = acc·sx[m]·sw[n] + b`). q8 flips from the *slowest* GPU mode
(dequant overhead) to the **fastest**; cross-K/V stays fp16 (fidelity-sensitive), attention
QK/AV stays fp16. Graph-capturable (graph-vs-inline byte-identical). 60 s warm, RTX 3070:

| mode | small 60 s | medium 60 s | GPU VRAM (med) |
|---|---|---|---|
| fp16 (default, exact) | 0.55 s (DiT 0.40 + dec 0.13) | 1.43 s (DiT 0.96 + dec 0.43) | 4.46 GB |
| q8, fp16-dequant (old) | 0.62 s (DiT 0.47) | 1.62 s (DiT 1.11) | 3.40 GB |
| **q8 W8A8** | **0.46 s (DiT 0.30)** | **1.24 s (DiT 0.75)** | 3.40 GB |

(with the decoder mapping-conv-as-GEMM: decode small 0.16 → **0.13 s**, medium 0.48 →
**0.44 s**, audio rel 7e-7 — the fp32 conv ran as a naive kernel, 29/42 ms at 60 s.)
vs stable-audio-tools at 60 s: small 0.46 vs 0.41 (gap 1.46× → **1.12×**), medium 1.24 vs
1.32 — **aria now beats SAT on long-audio medium** (was 1.31× behind at the last audit);
fp16-exact is at ≈ parity (1.43 vs 1.32, 1.08×). 10 s small DiT 0.12 → 0.08 s.
Fidelity (single-step `-s 1` probe, isolates one DiT call): medium q8-dequant 3.2 % →
W8A8 7.3 % velocity-class error — between q8 and the supported q4's 9.3 %, i.e. a
legitimate point on the existing precision dial (opt-in, off by default).

**W8A8 on the CPU (NEON sdot, E15.2c).** The same `ARIA_W8A8` knob routes the CPU q8
block GEMMs through per-token int8 activations + exact-int32 sdot accumulation
(`aria_linear_q8a8`; sdot / vmull / scalar paths are bit-identical). **Pi 5, 10 s
small-music: q8 DiT 57.3 → 22.8 s (2.5×), total 67.5 → 32.6 s** — q8 flips from the
slowest CPU mode to the fastest (fp32 measured 44.3 s in the same session; the box ran
soft-thermal-limited, so absolute numbers are conservative).

**Banded DiT self-attention: measured and REJECTED.** Per-layer softmax mass at 60 s
(S=710, small-music, CPU instrumentation): the 64 memory tokens absorb 17–53 % of every
audio query's attention, and even memory-prefix + a ±256 band (79 % of all keys) covers only
**86–96 %** of the mass depending on layer (±128: 70–92 %). The DiT's self-attention is
genuinely global — unlike the medium *decoder*'s architectural ±17 window — so a windowed
approximation would discard 4–30 % of attention mass per layer and was not wired in. This is
the flash-attention counterpoint: the only remaining long-audio attention lever is a real
fused-softmax kernel (cuDNN-class), not sparsity.

## Streaming / continuation on GPU (small-music, 8 steps, RTX 3070)

Continue/inpaint used to be gated to the CPU DiT (the local-additive inpaint cond was
CPU-only). Porting it to the device DiT (reuse the CPU-projected per-block `local_emb`,
upload it, add after cross-attn via the existing `k_add`) makes `--continue`/`--inpaint`/
`--stream` run on the GPU. The taae context encoder stays on the CPU.

- **Parity:** GPU vs CPU continuation, same seed → regen region **corr = 1.0000, rel_rmse
  0.45 %** (pure fp16 DiT noise; the local-cond is uploaded + added in f32, so bit-identical).
  CPU and GPU `--stream` outputs are identical to 2 decimals per second.
- **Speed:** an 18 s continuation **6.92 → 2.54 s (2.7×)**. Streaming per-chunk (4 s emit,
  14.5 s window): CPU **RTF ~0.6×** → GPU **RTF ~4×** (chunk ~1.0 s). Crosses real-time with
  ~3× headroom → smooth live playback (`--stream -o - | play …`, writer thread overlaps gen).
- **Decay ceiling (device-independent):** for prompts whose chunk-0 emit reaches SA3's
  natural outro fade (e.g. "ambient pads", "funk groove"), the chained continuations inherit
  the fade and drift to silence past ~9 s. Steady-energy prompts ("melodic techno") hold.
  This is the inpaint-envelope-drift limit of the post-hoc method, not the GPU — CPU and GPU
  decay identically. See PAPER.md (beat-sync loop / streaming-trained model).
- **Re-anchoring (`--anchor <beta>`, E14b) bounds the decay.** Each continuation context is
  blended toward the chunk-0 reference tail (convex, conditioning-only) and its RMS pulled
  back to the reference level (boost-only, ≤4×, then a ≤0.97 peak guard for the encoder).
  Measured on the worst-case "ambient pads" (8 chunks, seed 0, RTX 3070): baseline sinks
  −15.5 dB tail-vs-head and keeps falling (−34 dB); `--anchor 0.35` settles at ~−26 dB and
  *recovers* (−8.8 dB drop; β 0.5/0.7 similar) — the stream no longer dies. The energy
  correction is what matters: a plain amplitude blend only softened the drop (−13.1 dB).
  `--evolve <n>` (E14c) adds the SA3-Realtime-style seed policy: default = fixed seed every
  chunk (the voice carries forward); `--evolve N` re-seeds every N chunks for variation.
  Defaults byte-identical (anchor/evolve off: GPU + CPU streams cmp-equal to pre-change).

## Steering efficiency — aria vs sf-api (E12)

Same residual steer (`delta = α·norm·unit`) through the aria C runtime and the sf-api PyTorch
reference (`sa3-sf-api/experiments/efficiency_compare.py`). 10 s / 8 steps, steered, RTX 3070.
**Warm = in-process resident (`--bench` warm-min) on both sides**; a one-shot aria CLI
invocation additionally re-pays per-process setup (T5 encode on CPU + weight upload —
"invocation" row):

| metric | aria small | sf-api small | aria medium | sf-api medium |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GPU warm steered gen | **0.16 s** (2.2×) | 0.358 s | **0.46 s** (1.2×) | 0.547 s |
| GPU per-invocation (one-shot CLI) | 1.23 s | — | 2.55 s | — |
| cold start (process+load+gen) | **1.6 s** (5×) | 7.9 s | **2.9 s** (6×) | 17.5 s |
| GPU peak VRAM | **1395 MB** (2.2×) | 2999 MB | **4215 MB** (1.3×) | 5375 MB |
| CPU warm steered gen | **3.5 s** | — | **11.2 s** | — |

aria wins every axis measured apples-to-apples. Two earlier claims were measurement artifacts,
now retired: "aria 0.10 s / 3.4× faster" (aria *unsteered* graph path vs sf-api steered) and
"steering disables the graph → aria 3.4–4.6× slower warm" (aria *fresh-process* vs sf-api
in-process). In-process at 10 s scale, graph/no-graph/steered are all ≈0.16 s — per-step launch
overhead is not the bottleneck there; the per-invocation gap is process setup (→ `--batch`).

Steering is bit-exact parity-verified (`tests/steer_verify.sh`: scale-0 byte-identical,
`steer(2α,d)≡steer(α,2d)`), CPU + GPU. Since commit `bf00c9e` the CUDA graph **stays captured
while steering**: the steer kernels are recorded into the graph and read a device-resident
effective scale (0 outside the step window → bit-exact no-op) refreshed per step like
`dx`/`dgcond`; steered graph-vs-inline output is byte-identical (full + windowed).

## Raspberry Pi 5 (edge target, E15)

First measured deployment on the paper's edge device — **Raspberry Pi 5, 4× Cortex-A76,
8 GB**, small-music fp32, 8-step, CPU only (`make ARCHFLAGS="-mcpu=native"`), windowed
decode (E16.1) active:

| model / build | 10 s clip | peak RSS |
|---|---|---|
| small fp32, scalar / gcc autovec | 50.5 s | ~1.9 GB |
| **small fp32, NEON (E15.2)** | **28.4 s** | ~1.9 GB |
| small q8, scalar dequant | 276 s | 2.9 GB |
| small q8, **NEON dequant (E15.2b)** | **67.1 s** (4.1×) | 2.9 GB |
| small q8, **W8A8 NEON sdot (E15.2c)** | **32.6 s** (2.1× over dequant; DiT 57.3→22.8 s) | 2.9 GB |
| **medium q4, NEON** | **242 s** | **6.79 GB — fits the 8 GB board** |

(small fp32 NEON: 4 s clip 16.6 s; GEMM 34 → 58 GFLOP/s, K-blocked 12.9 → 52.6.)

≈ **0.35× realtime** for small on a $80 board, and — the paper's edge claim, measured —
**the 1.2 B-parameter medium variant generates on the Pi at 4-bit** (windowed decode +
q4 + NEON dequant are jointly the enabler: fp32 medium would not fit, and the pre-E16.1
monolithic decode would have blown the 8 GB budget). NEON-vs-scalar parity 3.8e-5; full
test suite green on ARM. Remaining levers: E15.3 params-on-disk (headroom below 6.8 GB),
sdot int8 path, threads-vs-thermals tuning.

## Generation-speed optimization pass (2026-07, audit-driven)

Eight measured levers from a multi-lens code audit. Each is byte-/parity-gated; the
default (fp16 GPU / fp32 CPU, 8 steps) is untouched unless noted.

| # | lever | where | measured | gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | `--fast` = 6 steps | sampler | ~25 % off every DiT-bound path (med GPU 1.43→1.19, CPU 60 s 55.9→44, Pi q8 32.6→27) | wav2taste: 8→6 drift < seed noise on both tiers |
| A2 | GPU micro-pack (softmax writeback drop, FF-bias fold, fp16-emit producers) | `aria_cuda.cu` | 60 s exact: small 0.55→0.49, **medium 1.43→1.28 (beats SAT 1.38)**; W8A8 med 1.24→1.17 | fp16 byte-identical (graph+inline) |
| A3 | warm-request reuse + 8-way T5 LRU | `aria_cuda.cu`, model | per-request setup 0.03→0.01 s; batch/sweeps skip graph rebuild + re-encode | bench/batch byte-identical |
| A4 | CPU glue pack (parallelize+vectorize glue, collapse(head,qblock), conv-interchange, `OMP_WAIT_POLICY=active`) | `aria_cpu.c`, `aria_sa3_dit.c` | i9 small 60 s CPU 16.3→11.3 s; SAT gap 1.47×→1.09×; Pi small 10 s 39.2→28.4 s | CPU + GPU byte-identical |
| B2 | fp16/bf16 CPU storage **+ overlay source-release** | `aria_quant.c`, `aria_sa3_dit.c` | Pi peak RSS fp32 1913 → fp16 1199 (−37 %) → **q8 835 MB (−56 %)**; i9 W8A8 2426→982 MB | fp16 rel 5.5e-3; W8A8/GPU byte-identical; unit-tested |
| B3 | opt-in decoder q8 (`ARIA_DEC_Q8`, ARM sdot) | `aria_taae.c`, decoders | **ARM-only**: Pi small decode 5.03→3.54 s (1.4×); **x86 is a 2× loss** (packed-fp32 wins) → do not enable on x86 | rel 9.0 % small / 2.7 % med (q4-class); off by default |
| B4 | x86 AVX2 int8 GEMM (maddubs W8A8 + widening q8) | `aria_quant.c` | i9 W8A8 DiT 5.11→1.99 s (2.6×), q8-dequant 27→3.6 s (7.5×) vs scalar; fp32 still fastest x86 mode | W8A8 byte-identical (exact int32); unit-tested |
| B5 | streaming partial-emit range decode (E14.1) | decoders, model, `--stream` | Pi small-music continuation decode **5.22→1.67 s (3.1×)**; i9 medium 3.5→2.3 s (wider halo) | emitted audio byte-identical x86 **and** ARM; `ARIA_NO_RANGE` A/B |

The **overlay source-release** (B2) is the sleeper win: every CPU overlay (q8/q4/fp16)
was previously a footprint *add* (packed copy + still-resident fp32 mmap); `MADV_DONTNEED`
of the six big DiT block matrices after the overlay copies them makes it a *replace*,
so q8 on the Pi drops from RAM-negative to the smallest footprint. Two levers stay
opt-in because they lose on the wrong hardware: **W8A8** (`ARIA_W8A8`) is a CPU win only on
ARM sdot / a GPU win everywhere; **decoder q8** (`ARIA_DEC_Q8`) is ARM-only and carries a
q4-class fidelity cost on the final audio, so it is never on by default. Deferred with a
reason: a **cuDNN FlashAttention-2 build flag** (`FLASH=cudnn`, long-audio GPU only —
libcudnn dependency, must be graph-captured) and the **GPU-IMMA decoder** (device decode
already 0.13–0.44 s; 2 structs × 9 sites for a marginal, fidelity-risky gain).

## Takeaways

- **GPU memory:** aria's footprint is consistently smaller (−27 to −47 %) — a bump
  allocator with no caching-allocator slack vs PyTorch's reserved pool + CUDA context.
  Notably, **medium fp16 OOMs stable-audio-tools' naïve `.to(cuda).half()` load** on
  the 8 GB card (transient fp32 copy); aria runs medium GPU in 3.97 GB with headroom.
- **GPU speed:** aria **wins small-music (1.8×)** and reaches **≈ parity on medium**
  (0.54 vs 0.50 s) after the three GPU optimizations above.
- **CPU speed:** within **1.15–1.5× of PyTorch/MKL** after the **packed outer-product
  GEMM + K-blocking** (was 2.4× behind); aria's AVX2 GEMM runs **~460–622 GFLOP/s** on
  the big DiT shapes (MKL is ~600–700). For **long-audio medium aria now *beats*
  PyTorch** — the banded decoder keeps aria near-linear while SAT's medium decode grows
  superlinearly: at **60 s, aria CPU is 1.94× faster** (55.9 vs 108.4 s). small-music
  (decoder already chunked, no banded win) stays pure-GEMM where MKL leads ~1.3–1.5×.
- **CPU/host memory:** aria uses **~60 % less RAM** everywhere (mmap'd weights, no
  framework). Medium on CPU: aria 7.2 GB vs PyTorch 18.9 GB.

**Where aria wins:** dependency-free single binary, the smallest memory footprint
(GPU and CPU, −44 to −62 %), faster small-music GPU, ≈-parity medium GPU, and
**faster long-audio CPU** (1.94× at 60 s). **Where the PyTorch stack still edges
ahead:** short-clip CPU throughput (MKL, ~1.3×) and **long-audio GPU** (1.68× at 60 s
— PyTorch's cuDNN tensor-core flash attention; a matching aria kernel is deferred).
aria's niche is exactly the plan's:
run these models on budget/low-VRAM hardware without the framework — now also at
competitive (often better) speed.

## Memory notes (no-speed-loss optimizations)

The dominant consumer is the **weights** — fp16 on the GPU, F32 (mmap, zero-copy) on
the host — which is the speed-optimal storage, so it's off-limits without a precision
(speed) cost. The clean wins are in waste:

- **Host RAM on the GPU path: 7.26 GB → 0.44 GB steady-state** (medium). The host F32
  weights stay mmap-resident even after the fp16 copies are on the GPU; once uploaded
  they aren't read on the hot path, so `madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)` reclaims them (file-
  backed → re-faults cheaply if a small per-request MLP is touched). Biggest win.
- **Decoder arena −~90–100 MB** (GPU peak + CPU): the attention scratch and the FFN
  scratch were held in one arena scope though never live together — freeing the former
  before the latter drops the per-block peak from `16·N·D + 3·N·INNER` to `~17·N·D`.
- **Tried and reverted:** Q8 on `ca_to_kv` (cross-K/V) saved 170 MB VRAM but the cross
  projection is fidelity-sensitive (GPU-vs-CPU 0.7 % → 2.6 %) — not worth it.
- **Hard floor:** pure-CPU RAM is weights-bound (medium ~5.4 GB F32, needed for the
  fp32 compute that gives exact parity); reducing it means fp16 compute = slower.
